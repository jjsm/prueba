  As a user
  I want to log in to the swaglabs application
  to view the products.

  Rule: Customers needs to provide valid credentials to access the site

    @singlebrowser
    Scenario Outline: Login on with invalid credentials
      Given User is on the login page
      When User attempts to login with the following credentials:
        | username   | password   |
        | <username> | <password> |
      Then he should be presented with the error message
        | message   |
        | <message> |

      Examples:
        | username        | password       | message                                                                   |
